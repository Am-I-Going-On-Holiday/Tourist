Those tourists that come from areas without variants of concern that have not been vaccinated are required to present a negative test but are not subject to quarantine. Those unvaccinated who come from higher-risk areas must present a negative test and quarantine once they arrive. It is important to note, however, that there are no countries that are considered areas of concern by the Swiss authorities.     Those unvaccinated that come from high-risk areas without a valid visa and without meeting any of the travel requirements imposed by the Swiss government cannot enter the country. Some of these requirements are having a Swiss resident permit, A Schengen country resident permit, or a cross-border permit.     Those that are either unvaccinated or unable to show evidence of recovery from Covid will have to present proof of a negative PCR test (not older than 72 hours) or rapid antigen test (not older than 48 hours).
